# Priority 1: High (Polish & Ecosystem)

Important for v1.0.0 quality and ecosystem goals. Not blocking release, but recommended before ship.

---

## 1. Ensure All Widgets Have Examples

**Status:** Done

Verified that all widget types shipped with ratatui_ruby have at least one example showing how to use them.

**Action:**
- [x] Check widget manifest against example inventory
- [x] Create `widget_canvas_demo`, `widget_center_demo`, and `widget_overlay_demo`
