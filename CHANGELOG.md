## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-24

### Added

- **DSL for Simpler Apps**: Introduced `RatatuiRuby.main_loop`, a new entrypoint that simplifies application structure when you don't need control of the event loop or application lifecycle.
- **Calendar Widget**: Added the `Calendar` widget, allowing you to display monthly views and visualize date-based information.
- **Generic Charts**: Implemented the full `Chart` widget, which supersedes the now-deprecated `LineChart` and `BarChart` widgets, giving you more freedom to visualize data sets.
- **Enhanced List Styling**: You can now customize the appearance of selected items in a `List` using `highlight_style` and `highlight_symbol`.
- **Broader Ruby Support**: Added support for a wider range of Ruby versions: every non-EOL version. The latest preview of Ruby 4.0 is tested in CI, but not supported.
- **Dev Tools**: Added internal Rake tasks for managing historical documentation and SemVer checks.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-22

### Added

- **First Release**: Initial public release of `ratatui_ruby`, bringing the power of the Rust [ratatui](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) library to Rubyists!
- **Core Widget Set**: Includes a comprehensive suite of widgets to get you started:
  - `Block`, `Borders`, and `Paragraph` for basic content.
  - `List` and `Table` for structured data.
  - `Gauge` and `Sparkline` for progress and metrics.
  - `Tabs` for navigation.
  - `Canvas` for drawing shapes (Lines, Circles, Rectangles, Maps).
- **Layout System**: A flexible layout engine using `Flex`, `Layout`, and `Constraints` to build responsive interfaces that adapt to any terminal size.
- **Forms & Layers**: Primitives like `Overlay` and `Center` for creating modal dialogs, plus a `Cursor` widget for text input interactions.
- **Styling**: Full support for `Ratatui`'s styling primitives, including modifiers and RGB/ANSI colors.
- **Input Handling**: Robust handling for both Keyboard and Mouse events.
- **Testing Support**: Included `RatatuiRuby::TestHelper` and RSpec integration to make testing your TUI applications possible.
